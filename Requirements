Requirements
The purpose of the software is to provide a means to test a user's reaction time. A user must be able to customize the test 
to their needs, e.g. the testing area's size, the time until failure (duration at which the user is recognized to have reacted too slowly),
etc. The software must provide information about the user's performance (their actual speed, their rate of failure, their accuracy, etc.)
